4chanDownloader
===============

Downloads all images from any 4chan thread. The program creates a GUI with several options; board choices, thread lists (which is used for selecting links), a destination folder selector and a refresh button to refresh the GUI with the new selected options.

This program uses Jsoup to collect images. The GUI was built using NetBeans. It is the first working version of the project, so I am aware that the code structure isn't the greatest. Please feel free to revise these files or share suggestions.
